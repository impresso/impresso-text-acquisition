Preprocessing
=============

Motivation
----------

Unfortunately, not all data arrives ready for ingestion. 
In several cases, some preprocessing steps are necessary to prepare the data in order to reduce the complexity of the importers.
This preprocessing can include any of the following steps:
- Identification of the exact contents of the data which was dumped, and of the OCR formats present.
- Reorganization of the files to follow our prefered directory structure: `alias > year > month > day > edition > issue files`.
- Copying of image files into the IIIF server location, often also requiring reorganization, renaming and conversion of the files.
- Extraction of the OCR from PDFs in the case the OCR is embedded in PDFs.

Other preprocessing steps might also be necessary and depend on each provider.

Since these steps are so case-specific, we currently handle each situation with individual scripts, which are tailored to each provider.

Existing Preprocessing Scripts

British Library
***************

- Reorganizes and copies exiting data into the desired directory structure, separating images and OCR files for each issue.
- Logs all copies made and optionally skips issues if the copy was already done, after verification that all the desired files exist in the destination

SWISSINFO
*********

- Extract the OCR from PDF files, creating JSON files and convert the images to JP2 format.
- Reorganize and rename the files accordingly.
